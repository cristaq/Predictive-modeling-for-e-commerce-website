 # Predictive model based on the statistics of an e-commerce website

 Given some information about an website we want to determine if a certain browsing behaviour will result in a purchase.
 In the first part of the assignment we analize the data and use different charts for visualization.
 The prediction is generated using two approaches: decision tree and logistic regression. 
 Both are implemented by hand for academic purposes and then compared to their already implemented counterparts from scikit-learning.
